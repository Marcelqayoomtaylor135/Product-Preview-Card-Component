## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to take advantage of SCSS' useful nesting and variable features. 


### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to be able to implement SCSS syntax faster and more accurately. I would also like to be able to incorporate mixins throughout. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Referemnce](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/) - W3Schools helped me a lot as it was my main reference for css syntax
